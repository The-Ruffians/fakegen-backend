        "description": "Project is to build a demo/POC level in Unity (3D and 2D) for Windows.  Non-essentials such as theme, style, story, etc. can be discussed at your discretion.  Project is two distinct phases.\n\nPhase 1:  Purpose of phase 1 is to build a crude 3D version of the level with the intent to iterate and “find the fun” in the design.  Focus on camera angles and timing the quick time events will be key.  Ultimate goal is to serve as a living story board for an animator.\n\n•\tUsing assets from the Unity asset store (at my expense and choice), build a 3D ranch style level using the layout of my crude drawings.  This includes finding and importing character and enemy models.\n•\tBuild player character and enemy paths and branches that take them down different rails depending on player choice via QTE’s.\n•\tTeach me how to modify camera angles and event timing to reduce your required labor.\n\nPhase 1 is successful when “fun” iterations are complete, level is fully playable, and camera work is finished, insofar as it is within your ability to control (i.e. you’ve set it up to my basic asks and taught me how to manipulate).  Since I’m asking that I be involved in the camera work I will not hold you liable for any extended period if I decide to continue to play with the camera.\n\nPhase 2:  This phase will commence after animation is complete on a separate contract.  The purpose of this phase is to apply the scripting and interactivity learned from Phase 1 to the animated frames.  Since it will be animated, this will take place in 2D and there will be no rails to follow, only getting from one frame to the next.\n\nPhase 2 is successful when the animated 2D version of the level is fully playable.\n\nI imagine most of the heavy lifting is done in Phase 1 so ¾ of the contract will be front loaded to that phase.  We can discuss milestones together, though, and even break into two contracts if agreed upon.",

If the phone number isn't in the database, prompt them to set a Pin.\n3. If the Pin matches the caller's phone number (or they've just set it), then the caller is able to \"leave a message\" using the Twillio Record API\n4. After the caller finishes their message and hangs up, the recording audio file gets uploaded to an S3 bucket and an SMS gets sent to my phone number (to be provided)\n5. Then, when I call the same Twilio number, prompt me for my 4 digit pin (which can be hardcoded) - then start playing the messages in order.\n 6. Then, I want to be able to respond to the caller with either an SMS or another voice call that gets recorded. After the SMS is sent or my voice message is uploaded to S3, the caller's original message gets deleted from S3.\n 7. After this, the caller should be notified by SMS that they have a voice message ready for them. They can then call the Twilio number and listen to the message. After they do so, my message should also be deleted from S3.\n\nPlease submit a timeline or ask any questions so you're able to provide a timeline to develop the MVP\n\nMore work on this project to follow after this initial MVP.\n\nThanks and I look forward to hearing from you!",

Furthermore there should also be a token made called $bearries. \n- The project is on IMX and the way the \"staking\" will work is by checking whether a user has the NFT listed on the marketplace or not. If it is not listed, the user will accumulate 10 $bearries / day pr NFT not listed. \n\nFurthermore a new collection should be made for the breeding system. The NFTs for the new collection can be bought for 300 $bearries / pr nft. \n\n- Once someone has enough $bearries (earned through staking), they should be able to 'mint' a new nft with their earned bearries. Since we call this mechanism 'breeding' the person should also own atleast 2 of the parent NFT to do so. Once they submit their breeding, their $bearries tokens will be burned/ or sent to an admin wallet and they will receive a new version of the NFT.",

Integrate HELCIM to get their Bank ACH Info connected to our system\n\n\n5.1 Cancel the Paypal email request when a sale occurs.\n\n5.2 We need to change the system so that we use Helcim to charge Crowdfunders via credit card when they crowdfund an eCommerce site.\n\n5.3 Update the system to reflect the new way of charging Merchants via ACH Deduction from user's bank account every time a sale is made.\n\n5.4 We also need to keep 2.5% from the crowdfunder's sales commission and send that to Go Fish Admin Dashboard to a new balance called \"\"Go Fish Crowdfunder Fee Balance\"\"; the rest goes to crowdfunder. For example, if crowdfunder is to earn 20%, we keep 2.5% and 17.5% goes to Crowdfunder. \"\n\"3.2 We need to recognize each time if 100% of the crowdfunding funds are paid back by 9 months, and if not, the [REMAINING AMOUNT] must be divided by [90] and that amount must be taken out of their bank account via ACH on a daily basis until 100% is fully paid back. \nFor example, if at the 9 month point there is 1,000 remaining, then we need to take 1,000 / 90 = $11.11 and once the days remaining are 80, then the remaining amount must be divided by 80 and paid back as such, and same when it is 70 days remaining, ect.\nThis needs to re-calculate every day, because sales will still occur and offset the balance, so the re-calculation must re-occur daily.\n (This same thing should happen each time a Crowdfunder crowdfunds an eCommerce site)\"",

The APIs I would like to aggregate are:\n\n- Shopify\n- Magento\n- Amazon\n- WooCommerce\n- Squarespace\n- Ebay\n- Etsy\n- Wix\n\nThese are my top priorities for now, with more coming down the pipeline in the future.\n\nThe API will allow customers to manage their different stores that they have connected to the API, all using a single set of API calls which will then call the appropriate 3rd party e-commerce APIs that they have connected their store to.\n\nI need someone to help make the backend for me. So far I have a FastAPI Python backend written up with calls to shopify and magento product APIs. There isn’t very much there I just wanted to prove the concept. I will be available to help with some of the backend work, but would like to put my focus on the frontend part of the project. \n\n### Requirements\n\nI would like the backend to be python, and I would like the API to be completely documented with OpenAPI specification. I would also like there to be tests to cover all the major portions of the API. The API should include authentication as well.\n\n### Use Case\n\nSomeone like [https://www.prosku.com/](https://www.prosku.com/) creates an account with our app, and is then able to add different stores to our database, with each store having at least 1 connection to one of the 3rd party ecommerce apps.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if a project like this would interest you and we could move further with negotiating some of the details.",

The latest revamp was with Sculpture Qode theme back in 2016. It has an image slider at the top of the homepage that looks good on desktop, but doesn't even show up on mobile! Among other things.\n\nSite 2: A newly created site for my real estate business. WordPress with Winning Agent theme. It's a little better looking than the travel site, But there are some funky blocks of space on mobile and I'm kinda scared to try and dive into the CSS myself. \n\nUltimately, I would like two sites that I can go in and create content for (blog posts, listing updates, etc) on a regular basis and hopefully use both sites to get some real estate leads. \n\nLet me know if you have any other questions and we'll go from there!

Jim sends a verification request to Bob for the image/video. Bob gives his approval. Now the image/video has the sticker of approval on it (from Bob’s consent) which, by clicking, Jim can now prove and show his friends (utilising some sort of hash key or zero knowledge protocol, etc) that Bob has verified his image/video. \n\nI want to then create a smooth step process whereby someone can upload an image/video, request approval and then show if the material has been verified or not (similar to when sending a friend request on Instagram - it’s either accepted or declined and you are notified when followed back). \n\nTHE PURPOSE: Be able to show one party has accepted and approved a verification request from the other party, and be able to prove it to external viewers without giving vital info away that would make it easy to copy. \n\nABOUT ME: I have a background in design however, coding is not my forte.

For example: (1) a checkbox “With Username” which if selected then the function only scrapes accounts with usernames and (2) type in field with dropdown box next to it, type in field for typing a number and dropdown for selecting Minutes/hours/days; if this field has typed in any number function will only scrape accounts that were last online corresponding time ago)\n2.\tThere will be two options to do with these scraped users: (1) to send them DM message and (2) to add them to another group\n3.\tThere also must be a field where you type the message that you want to text to these users that you scraped and left selected for the DM.\nNote. When sending the link it must be visible in a Preview Form and not just only a clickable link.\nObviously there must be SEND button in the end for sending the message\nNote: Nice touch would be to have popup asking if you are sure to send the message with “SEND” and “Cancel” buttons on it before actually sending it.\n4.\tProgram must automatically use all the accounts evenly for sending the DMs. For example: if you have 60 people to send message to and you have 10 accounts, 6 messages should be sent from each of them. Same goes when adding scraped users to a group, they must be added evenly from all the accounts to lower the risk of them getting suspended.\n\n\nAdmin Dashboard Page N4 – Shilling Bot\n- - - - -\nSend message(s) in group(s) repeatedly with fixed/variable time intervals\n1.\tThere must be a form with +ADD PROMO button at the end which adds entry to a list displaying all the ongoing promos.\n2.\tThe form has following fields to fill (1) Telegram Group username, (2) Time interval in secs/minutes/hours which indicates the delay before repeatedly sending the message and lastly (3) The message.\n3.\tOnce you hit +ADD PROMO button campaign is added to the list below the form. Every campaign within the list is ongoing which means that for every campaign in indicated groups, with indicated intervals, indicated messages are sent.\n4.\tAccounts bust be used consecutively for sending this messages to spread out the activity across all the accounts and avoid account bans as well as possible.\n5.\tLastly within the list, each campaign must have END button that ends the campaign and automatically makes it disappear from the list.\nNote: Nice touch would be to have popup asking if you are sure to end the campaign with “END” and “Cancel” buttons on it before actually ending it.\n\n\nPlease, check attached file for more understandable formatting of this text!",

        "description": "Hey, For an assignment I need to build an app in Mendix. The app doesn't have to be too big and complicated. My question to you is can you build this app for me? The app is intended for a fictitious travel agency. I'm looking forward to your response!\n\nUserstories:\n\nAs a Customer I want to be able to Request a Flight Booking (Create a Request)\nAs a Customer I would like to View my History of Previous Travel Requests\nAs a Travel Agent I would like to make a Provisional Booking Based on a Customer\nAs a Travel Agent I want to Send a Customer a Provisional Booking to Review\nStories and the WAP Revisited\nAs a Travel Agent I want to Receive an Error if there isn't Anymore Space on a Flight\nAs an Agent I want to Cancel All Provisional Bookings that have not been Accepted\nAs an Agent I want to Confirm Bookings Customers have Paid for so they don't Expire\n\nCase:\nBounce Travel agency is a small travel agency that provides travel all over the world to major sporting events by air. As the numbers drop, they want to increase profits by attracting the younger crowd. To do this, they want to build an app that  \nsupports the process of requesting a trip online. At this point, a customer needs to call or visit the store to book a flight. The customer is assigned an agent who then goes through the itinerary with the customer. When the details of the trip are clear to the agent, he can look for suitable flights and select multiple flights. Alternatives are examined together with the customer, after which the flight can be booked.\n  \nTo prevent a flight from being overbooked, an agent can make a provisional booking. The customer can then think about possible alternative flights. When a customer accepts a booking, the agent will confirm it after payment. Sometimes it takes a while for a customer to make a decision. The customer has a total of 5 days to make a decision, otherwise the agent will cancel the provisional booking. Because agents often have busy schedules, canceling overdue bookings is often forgotten. If the deadline is exceeded, this will result in a fine. In the app, all overdue bookings must therefore be canceled automatically by the system.  \n\nIn addition to making it easier for customers to access travel bookings, the system should also provide greater visibility into the status of their current and past requests. To make this possible, customers must be able to register with Bounce Travel Agency. In addition, this reduces Bounce's administration costs, as agents no longer have to process their customers' address details when booking a flight.",

The commerciality of this product has been referred to by one of the worlds most famous VC’s as the Tesla of our sporting industry. As this project is so commercially viable and our investors are public names, we cannot interview any candidate without a Mutual NDA signed. If you are happy to comply, we can share the job description in detail. We want someone who can build our Augmented Reality section of our product using smart lenses. We really need someone who understands the wearable AR space. An example would be if X moves, then the sporting field lines on the ground would in turn move with X. That is just the beginning. We have teamed up with major clubs in this sport and player and sponsors of their global brands who want to get behind this project. So as Wilkitude is the leading eyewear AR platform, we thought that would be a good space to start to look for an expert who can drive a team to build out the application in stages with the Utopian Vision in mind. Of course we expect a lot of iterations along the way as we ourselves understand the capabilities of the platform. If any candidate strongly believes their is a better platform or custom solution for our company, we are open to ideas. The candidate must be open minded. Have a passion for the sport. A passion for AR. They must also share the vision of the company. The board have allocated up to a 2.5% dilution of their shares for this candidate, who’s role is to bring all our months of mechanical and industrial engineering and associated patent pending and “game changing” tech / engineering to life with a Wikitude OR ALIKE  platform. the successful candidate must be dynamic and on the edge of this space. A forward thinker, have the ability to think outside the square and beyond! The candidate will not only initially bring the MVP alive, but also present their own ideas and help build and grow a team of technology experts to create the Utopian System we desire. Anyone short of being able to achieve the above need not apply. We believe that you create with the future in mind. So only someone highly passionate about this space with a genuine desire to earn significant amounts of money if KPI’s are hit, need apply. To find out more please send me your company name, full name, Country, ZIP or Postal Code for me to send a 2 x page mutual NDA, in order to show you the technology and discuss the role in detail. I look forward to interviewing experts in AR developers who have designed operating systems for eyewear / lenses companies in the past.",

Once signed in, there's a simple card/div that confirms the user's email address, name, role and report, which is pulled from the Realtime database that contains the user's details.\n\nWhen a new user is created either via the basic user sign up or the first time a Google user signs in, they are automatically assigned a default role and report. (Please see attached screenshot that shows the structure of the reports list that I had)\n\nThe app is no longer working and it may be due to the expiration of credentials on my Firebase account. I'm not sure, but I need someone who is familiar with Firebase and JS to help me sort this. \n\nThere is nothing in my Realtime database anymore so it may have been wiped.

There will not be a full report prepared \nfrom this only an Appendix which will be created in Word to insert into a full report.\nThe system needs to be able to recall the reports by date and name with the user being able to document and edit the report afterwards in the comfort of his office, in a coffee shop or in their home. We would like the report to be co-branded with company but the user can select their own logo and their own details. An Example report is within this document.\n\nThe user will have a user interface. Where they will select ‘Location’ and ‘Subject’ he will be able to take two photographs for the report with additional photos going into the Appendix. Once report has been completed additional editing can be done to change photos and put notes together for appendix. \nThe reports will need to stay available on the server with the option of a company login so reports can be shared to each user. \nLocations:\n• External\n• Carpark\n• Front Entrance\n• Roof \n• Plant Room \n• Electrical Intake Room \n• Electricity Meter\n• Gas Meter\n• Water Meter\n• Floor areas\n• Toilets \n• General Internal Areas\n• Purchasing\n• Billing\nUsers can add Areas to the Local application off and online\nThere are also Subjects to be selected:\n• Heating \n• Cooling \n• Lighting \n• Power \n• Ventilation \n• Building Management Systems\n• Legislation \n• Energy Management \n• Water \n• Renewables",

There are many more opportunities to help us meet our super tight deadline.\n\nTLDR:\nBuild a lambda function in NodeJS that has an API using API Gateway. It takes a file as input, encrypts the file using a Public Key, saves it to S3, and then returns a 200 Status with the Files URL.\n\nPOST File Description\n1. Your lambda function should take a file and then encrypt the file using a public Key.\n2. Generate a UUID and save a record to a DynamoDB Table called “LookUp” that just contains id & name for each of the “values” (The goal here is to use UUIDs as the file name so that we’re not storing the file with its original name.\n3. The encrypted file should be uploaded to S3\n4. The URL for the encrypted file should be returned with a 200 API response.\n\nGET File Description\n1. User makes GET request to API and requests a specific file using the file’s name (The UUID we requested earlier). The function grabs the file from S3, then uses a Private Key on the backend to decrypt the file. The decrypted file is then passed to the frontend with a 200 response and the original file name (Get the original file name from the lookup table)\n\nHow to get the job\n1. You can complete this in the next 8 hours.\n2. You have experience working with S3, DynamoDB, Lambda, NodeJS.\n\nYou should be familiar with the following\n\nNodeJS\nAWS Lambda\nAWS Step Functions\nDynamoDB\nAWS SQS\nAWS SQS-SLQ\nAWS SNS\n\nYou will need to answer why and how you are going to accomplish this.\n\nLooking to build long term relationships with experts and if we enjoy your work, we are launching 180+ apps in the next 12 months that can use your expertise to create additional modular lambda functions. This job is a test of your capabilities, if you perform well we will provide you with an abundance of work.",

I need a PHP script that automatically authenticates and gets a new token so that it can pull from the Google Sheets API all the time without expiring and breaking the flow.\n\nI've been through this tutorial:  https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/php, which worked fine until the token expired.  This needs to be a web-page that connects, as opposed to a command-line script.\n\nI can provide you access to all these accounts and the spreadsheet and API keys and FTP access to the server.

This however is specific for the Solana Blockchain and works a little differently. More detail on how it works here: https://solana.com/validators\n\nWe want to demonstrate that we offer a secure and institutional grade service, so the landing page design could look and feel very clean and modern. For example: https://chain.link/\n\nHere are some examples of others providing the same service:\nhttps://chorus.one/networks/solana/\nhttps://www.alphapro.io/\n\nWe are open to any other suggestions and like your portfolio so open to design ideas. The logo used is our own design and can be used commercially.\n\n2 asks:\n- Design a clean landing page. This should include everything from, graphics fonts (big fans of typewriter style fonts). There should be a lot of whitespace for the landing page and background should be white.\n- The logo is attached. We would like to use this logo, but if you could re-create some variations of this same logo in different sizes (white, black etc) with the name 'SolanaState' and logo by itself. Essentially we want a folder with 'brand assets' we can use. \n\nNote: The landing page should be very clean / simple. No over the top designs, not too many gradients or colours.",

Thank you\n\nUpdate & Clarification\nCurrently we have 3 strategies; 1 for both Buy and Sell entry condition. 1 for Buy Only for to use in an uptrend, and 1 for Sell Only to use in downtrend..  All 3 bots currently have adjustable inputs for target profit 1 &2, stop loss, and Auto Breakeven with offset.  \n\nOur primary goal is to have someone helps us to add an ATM strategy to these bots with adjustable inputs in the strategy setting.  The ATM strategy should executed upon the Buy or Sell conditions.  This should be able for us to drag the Stop Loss, or Target Profit on the chart as desired, rather than the fixed Target/Stoploss that the bot would not allow us to adjusted once the trade is executed.",

Listed below are things I will highlight for the site. If I move forward with you, I will provide detailed rough drafts on PDF that breaks the entire website down page by page including notes for you and etc. \n\nAFFILIATE MARKETING\nThe site I'm seeking will be tied into an affiliate program, so If you have experience with affiliate marking like amazon and spencers has at the bottom of their website then that will be a huge plus. \n\nCUSTOMIZABLE\nThe most complex part of my site is that models will be able to customize (build) their own profile within the site. \n\nPAID SUBSCRIPTION\nI will reach out to ccbill or segpay once the site is created to handle monthly recurring payments.. The site will have a monthly subscription with a free area as well.\n\nLOGO\nI have all this\n\nCONTENT \nWe are all adults. If you cant see girls in lingerie then I wont be able to work with you. \n\nEXPERIENCE\nI have worked with a ton of freelancers over the years and all of them love working with me because you wont have to babysit me. I know exactly what I want on my end but at times Ill question you to see your level of expertise to see if I can implement my idea fully. Sometimes I have to scale down some but as long as we communicate, we both will work our ways through it. I'm a business owner,not a developer. With that being said I'll do my best on my side. All I ask is that I don't have to teach you how to do your job. I want you to teach me and give me good advice along the way in your line of work. I'm vey flexible and understanding. I will work with your ideas (advice) so we both can have a good work relationship together.",

All interested females will likely be active in Social Media and have a following that she will be encouraging to register into the website for domestic tourism related employment opportunities, and to \"donate\" her salary via crowdfunding. Whether she raises a million dollars or $500, all funds raised by \"Contestants\" or \"Woocommerce Products\" will be distributed to each \"Contestant\" who earned it, thus fulfilling the goal of Making Women Wealthier.\n\nYOUR JOB is to review the PDF documentation from the plugin developers, and help integrate it into our website so that in each country, the Top-20 Contestants will appear in our website, in the appropriate locations. This means that Contestants registering for VIETNAM will only appear in the VIETNAM dynamically generated VIETNAM page.  You will see each country has 5 empty 1x4 horizontal HTML boxes, which show where the shortcodes will display links to the profiles of the Top-20 \"Contestants\" or \"Woocommerce Products\". Look for a sample profile at the plugin developers site at https://fantasticplugins.com/galaxy-funder-woocommerce-crowdfunding-system/  As they use Woocommerce with Storefront Theme, we do the same. \n\nOur Web page generates dynamic data, using a custom PHP template \"country_details.php\". We have created a STAGING site for your convenience. You will receive our URL after you have been hired. Your project will be considered completed when dummy data appears correctly in the 1x4 HTML tables, and the plugin has been configured so that if we advertised today, Contestants would be able to register and launch their advertising campaigns.",

Clicking \"Save\" in the modal will save the custom field (basically the logic in Orgs::ImportCustomFieldsController)\n- On the items table, it currently paginates and has page number. Change this to only have previous and next buttons, and logic will be similar to ActivityLogsController#index, where it doesn't perform a count nor use offset for the SQL under the hood. This uses jQuery Datatables, and there is a post here that may help in changing the UI portion. https://datatables.net/forums/discussion/52175/pagination-without-using-offsets\n- User activity log currently shows when people create or delete a cycle count. Add logging for when cycle count properties change.\n- An admin can add users to the org, but they cannot specify default location. Add functionality to select default location in a new column that is a drop down menu. Default location (location ID) should be stored in the user's custom data. Make sure that when users log in, this default location is used if one is specified. Users can switch locations, and this is saved via cookie, so just use the cookie if it's there, otherwise use the default location specified.\nThere will likely be more work if you do a good job.

I've secured  permission from the owner of a software plugin to try and update it. My personal needs are to update the codebase to support .Net 4.7.2 and .Net 6 as well as VS2019 and VS2022.\n\nThe code was last updated in 2011 which means it probably needs VS10. Unfortunately the installer checks to see if VS10 (or possibly earlier) is installed and fails to install if not. Seems VS12 is oldest installer still on their site. If install is successful, it also installs the source code.\n\nTasks\n1) Get the installer working to the point where you can obtain the project source code.\n2) Get codebase to compile under .Net 4.7.2 and .Net 6\n3) Upgrade the VSIX code, etc. to create VSIXs for VS2019 and VS2022\n\nDeliverable:\nSolution consisting of the above code that will compile under .Net 4.72 in VS19 and VS22 and under .Net 6 in VS22\n\nNote: This code may not work 100% due to the platform changes and that is fine. You just need to get the basic migration done. I have a team to work on the rest. Since I don't know what the actual code looks like, this may be as simple as a recompile or is may require some effort, but that effort should not be extensive.",

        "description": "I wish to develop an EA for use on RENKO charts on MT4.\n\nThe EA is based on using two indicators, a 10 MA and the On Balance Volume indicator, both of which are integral to MT4.\n\nOBV_MA_Renko EA:\n\nTrades are triggered by the slope of both indicators.\nLong trades are triggered exclusively on upward sloping lines and shorts when the line is sloping down.\n\nI would like to code values for the degree of slope for both indicators and be able to input values for these in the EA control panel.\nA horizontal MA or OVB line could be given the value zero. A vertical line up (longs) could be +10 and vertical down (shorts,) -10.\nI wish to enter values separately for each indicator.\n\nLong trades occur on the close/open of a Renko brick after crossing above the MA provided slope is equal to or greater than set (+) value.\nShorts are the opposite.\n\nIf price has crossed the MA, but slope is less than the set value the EA will wait until the set value is reached before entering a trade.\n\nTrades will be closed when price crosses the MA in the direction counter to that of the trade. i.e. A short will be closed once price crosses the MA in an upward direction and vice versa.\n\nLot size will be controlled by the EA and will be adjustable in the control panel.\n\nIdeally I would like to incorporate trailing stop and set stop loss features as well as auto lot size based on a set increment value and related to account balance.\nThe inclusion of these features will depend upon price, so I may wish to add these later.\n\nAre you interested/able to code for artificial intelligence programmes?\nI wish to develop an AI/deep learning programme to evaluate and control this and other EA's.\nFor that there is the need to harvest data. To evaluate the EA manually there is also the need to extract data from MT4 and display that visually.\nIs this something you can do?\nI would see data display as one separate job and AI development as another. These tasks are for the future and the first would be to display data from MT4.\n\nPlease let me know if you are interested in this work and please submit a price for the EA as the first stage.\nI have learned that standard procedure on Upwork seems to be to ask me for my budget and double that for the price.\nI am not interested in that approach. Please quote your best price only and see whether we can proceed from there.\nI currently have limited financial resources, but I wish to provide very good funding for subsequent stages of my project.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nStu Pearson.",

So it can be competitive compared to our competitors. \n\nThe important thing here is that we already have a decent website (https://far-out.io/), which was mainly designed and built by myslef. So the task here is not to just build a new website, but to convert the current one into a world-class one and also add some new pages. \n\nThe minimum requirements are as follow (PLEASE make sure you have all before reaching out, otherwise we both get into trouble down the road when the expectation won't meet. Appreciated! )\n\n1. (important) You should be willing to learn about our app and have the business context. It is obviously not a difficult task and you can do it by reviewing our website and checking out these simple tutorials (https://far-out.io/help). Having a good understanding of our business is the key to designing and developing the website in a much better. And of course, I do whatever you need to understand our business and app. \n \n2. Your team should have a designer who is an expert in Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop or similar tools to design and handle any new designs that we decide to pursue. \n\n3. Your team should have a developer who understands the basics of HTML, CSS, and PHP. In other words, if we are needed to do some customization beyond drag & drop in plugins (like Elementor), this person helps us to make the job done. \n\n4. Your team should have a good understanding of SEO. We take SEO seriously and have already put a lot of effort into it. So we don't want to screw up the SEO stuff during the development. \n\n5. Your team is familiar with the common plugins for WordPress (like Elementor).\n\nExamples of our competitive websites:\n\nhttps://loox.app/\nhttps://alireviews.io/\nhttps://stamped.io/\n\nSome remarks:\n\n1. I appreciate your business, but please reach out only if you have all the requirements and you are confident enough to build a world-class website that follows SEO rules, converts visitors, has a high speed, and is eye-catching. \n\n2. Consider this project as a long-term collaboration. We're a fast-growing company and over time we add new features and new announcements that require you to implement new changes and also take care of the site maintenance. \n\nLooking forward to talking with you.\n\nTalk soon, \nSina",

The lambda function should use \"sequelize\" to perform the basic CRUD operations on a database table (RDS). I believe that sequelize can actually create the tables and fields automatically from a model file, which would be preferable.\n\nHere's what I need you to do (I will provide access to my AWS account):\n\n1 ) Create a SAM template for a single API endpoint, connected to a lambda function. The template can just create a single API path (with POST/GET/etc.), and the lambda function should connect to an RDS database and permit the basic CRUD commands on a single table. I would prefer to use sequelize for the database connection and execution.\n\n2 ) CodePipeline should be setup to deploy the SAM template from my git repo. I assume this will be the easy part!\n\n3 ) I want a swagger-like API doc showing the API endpoints (sort of like petstore.swagger.io). I'm not sure if this needs to be created using SwaggerHub, or if it can be done automatically from the sequelize model file, or...?\n\n3 ) Zoom with me for about 30 minutes (or more or less) to show me how this all works!\n\nI'm just looking for a \"proof of concept\" right now. So just ONE or TWO database tables (with API endpoints + CRUD operations) is sufficient. I basically want you to help me get set up.\n\nIMPORTANT: You must be available immediately to do this work!

        "description": "I am trying to learn how to use this boilerplate app: https://github.com/NoQuarterTeam/boilerplate.\n\nIt has lots of structure to its approach (inputs/model/resolver/hooks and mailer).\n\nI would like someone to create a new feature that follows the conventions adopted by this boilerplate. I'd like the feature to be a model that has a relationship with the user model, has a form to create a new record in a psql db and sends a notification to the user on successful db creation. I'd like for each of the steps to complete that work to be covered with a note explaining each step (ie, step 1, create the model in schema.prisma then yarn db:migrate). I need this level of detail to try and figure out how the process is intended to work between back and front end.\n\nI'd also like there to be an additional feature which fetches some data from the star wars api (with similar user notes on how to do that).\n\nI'm interested in learning the api and web packages of this repo (not interested in the app, so no need to create anything in that package).\n\nI appreciate that there are lots of different ways to get things done. I'd specifically like to follow the approach set out in this boilerplate repo.\n\nIf you can help with this, and are available to complete this assignment, please could you write 'apple' at the top of your response.\n\nPlease could you also demonstrate that you have reviewed the repo and understand the architecture by adding a note to address how the RegisterDocument const was created in the web/src/lib/types/graphql.tsx file.",

The visitor can then review all of the available time slots and instantly book their appointment and the artist will be notified within the app.\n\nCompatibility:\nThe booking engine needs to integrate into our Wordpress website and the app would be compatible with Apple and Android devices.\n\nTracking:\nWe need to keep track every time a user books an appointment through our calendar. The tricky part is that every stylist uses their own Calendar on different platforms. So the app would integrate all of the artist's calendars and would populate search results based on salon location, service offered (requested), availability on the requested day/time slot. The salon needs a confirmation every time a web visitor books an appointment on their calendar FROM our website. This is so we can keep track of the amount of clients we are sending leads to our artists. \n\nCalendars: \nThe booking platforms that would be integrated are:\nBooker: https://apidoc.booker.com/Content/index.html\nGoogle Calendar: https://developers.google.com/calendar/api\nSquare: https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/bookings-api\nBooksy: https://booksy.com/biz/en-us/features\n\nPlease review the api links from the calendars above and let us know if any of them do not offer integration into a custom app.\n\nOverall Experience:\nThis is what we expect when we go live.\n1. A website user goes to our site and clicks on the Book An Appointment button.\n2. The user is asked a series of questions about the appointment they'd like to book and the based off of their answers, the booking engine will populate only artists that fit their requirements.\n\nFor example. I would like a \"Women's Haircut\" at \"Specific Location\" on \"Friday\" at \"3PM\". Once they submit this request, the booking engine will search through every one of our artists and show the profile of all availability artists that offer women's haircuts at that location and have an open slot on their calendar at Friday 3PM.  This is going to be very similar to StyleSeat, the difference is that they have a platform that displays results for every artist in the city, opposed to showing just our artists. \n\nConclusion:\nPlease feel free to ask any follow up questions before submitting a bid. This is the first phase of 3 projects. If the experience with the developer is excellent, then there is more work to be done if interested. I will be presenting all bids to the team on Tuesday, March 1st.",

The solution we're seeking will be a Windows Application that can run on any Win 10 machine.\n\nWhile File Juggler does some of what we want, it has many limitations that make cause us to seek a better solution. The limitations include:\n1. The text reading is not good enough. The PDF scanner we're using properly reads the OCR, and other programs can \"see\" the characters, albeit File Juggler is missing lots of text.\n2. Better flow of process, including order execution of Rules. File Juggler doesn't allow for the user to assign an order of Rule processes. We want a solution that allows for rule priority.\n3. Nested Rules. We want some rules to be nested within other rules\n4. Ease of adding rules, search terms, etc...  Here, File Juggler does a pretty good job and the interface works \"well enough,\" albeit it would be better to have the ability to use outside data as well.\n5. Source code in a format that allows the user to make adjustments as needed. Likely the source code will need to be in Visual Basic, albeit this requirement is possibly waivable if it still allows for all other requirements to be met.\n6. While it's not likely we will attempt to sell the solution, we want the ability to do so.

The project is simple, but I need an experienced developer because everything must work properly.\n\nWhat I do: \nI work as a marketer, and currently have a client who has several sites where he wants to implement pop-ups with affiliate links. An example would be when a user visits a website, sees a banner or button below some text, and when they click on it, a pop-up will be loaded. The pop-up contains a CTA button. When the user clicks the button, three links will appear, depending on the user's country, different links are displayed.\n\n- Responsive web design / POP-UP \n- Redirect based on country\n- It would be desirable that the pop-up component can be uploaded on one site (server) and then invited to any site via a script that the client wants. Example: client can add onclick=\"CallPop-UpScript()\" into banner or button on any site.\n\nThe pop-up design has already been done in Figma. Both desktop and mobile versions. \nI have attached a file where you can see what it looks like. \n\nSummary / Additional information:\nI need a developer to create a pop-up that will load when a user clicks a banner or button on a site. When it appears, Pop-up has a fade-in effect and the background of the page turns gray and the opacity is set to 65%. The Pop-up contains a CTA button, when the user clicks that button affiliate links appear. Anchor text / Affiliate links are preset within the script. It has three default links that are displayed to everyone. It is also necessary that it is possible, for example, to show different links only to German users. So different preset affiliate links (anchor text) for some countries can be placed. Affiliate links should open in new tabs.\n\n\nIf you have questions, please feel free to ask. Also if you want I can give you access to the Figma design project.",

I have had one person look at it and let me know that the API is not obvious right off the bat, but it might still be doable with a little more work. He had mentioned that I could potentially also use SELENIUM to pull the information that I need (I can copy and paste from the website directly into excel relatively easily). \n\nThe website: https://echa.europa.eu/information-on-chemicals/cl-inventory-database\n\nThe table: It looks like it can display up to 200 lines at a time.\n\n---- If this looks like a job you can do, please take a minute to review the site and let me know how you would approach the problem. -----\n\nBonus/Future Needs: I will not need this right away, but down the road I would like to potentially open up the far right column on the right side and copy some of the information from that URL. If this is also something you can do please let me know your thoughts. This would be a future expansion on the first project. \n\nThanks",

We have a fully-working web app in the 4-figure active MRR range from actual paying customers, but are still in beta and only launched a few months ago. We scaled our previous company to 7-figure revenue in the exact same space, but selling a much inferior product.\n\nSince our web app is already live and relatively bug-free, we are primarily looking for someone who can add features and API integrations FAST without breaking things, in addition to making further performance/security optimizations and maintenance.\n\nHere is our ideal candidate:\n- Strong knowledge and hands-on experience with Java, JS (TypeScript a plus), React, Sass, PostgresQL, AWS infra, Gitlab, and API integrations\n- Clean code principles and attention to detail with a focus on the pure functionality and being bug-free over design (don't worry, we take care of UX / UI and design, just make it responsive).\n- You pride yourself on being able to deliver on time and under pressure, with zero excuses.\n- You LOVE to build things, but are not great at the marketing/distribution/business side (we've got that covered)\n- You are obsessed with performance down to the millisecond and love to see improvements, no matter how incremental. You're also vigilant about security and enjoy \"playing defense\".\n- You are full of innovative ideas and suggestions on how to make things better\n- Relentlessly resourceful. Your best friends are Google, Stack Overflow, and the documentation. You don't need any hand-holding.\n- You love the freedom of async / remote work. We use a lot of Loom videos and Slack.\n- Put \"I'm definitely a human\" at the top of your application ;)\n- You have a growth mindset, and are looking for an opportunity to get into a winning startup in the earliest of days (less than 5 employees).\n- Willingness to sign an NDA\n\nIf you are interested in this project, please reply with your prior experience and if chosen, we can hop on a Zoom to discuss further :)\n\nCheers,",

With Aidin’s platform, along with our development and design partners and a passionate full-time team of 5, we have successfully provided measurable impact and improved outcomes for 30 of the best health systems across the country, helping them to safely connect patients to the best next care provider.\n\nAt Aidin, we strive to be a “Teal” company, embracing pillars of trust, responsibility, accountability, compassion, openness, respect, and equality. We value impact over roles, growth and learning over failure, and results over statistics. We value expertise, but also recognize that we are more than the sum of our parts. Every employee has a direct impact on our product and success.\n\nOur distributed team works 100% remotely on US Eastern Time, though we get together quarterly for team retreats.\n\nWe’re looking for a full-time, full-stack software engineer who is passionate about delivering value and providing solutions that improve the lives of our users and empower our client communities. We want people who take pride in designing, building, and maintaining the products they deliver, and are constantly seeking to master the skills that make this possible and learn new ones in the process.\n\n\nEssential Responsibilities\n\nAs a full-stack engineer at Aidin, you will collaborate with other engineers, product managers, and UI/UX designers to innovate, improve, and maintain our product.\n\nYou will touch on every aspect of our technology stack, and your opinions and decisions will directly affect our technical direction.\n\nYou will assist and lead in making architecture decisions at a team and product level, with respect to the performance and security needs inherent in the healthcare industry.\n\nYou will assist and lead in the development of solutions from inception through delivery.\n\nYou'll be expected to learn and understand the architecture of our core product, consisting of a responsive Javascript Single-Page Application on the front end (using React), a RESTful API-based Ruby on Rails back end, and a PostgreSQL database.\n\nYou will use this knowledge to debug product issues and suggest improvements and optimizations. \n\nYou will regularly review the code of your peers, upholding agreed-upon team standards.\n\nYou will be expected to thrive working both independently and alongside our extended team of developers of various skill sets and experience in an Agile environment.\n\nRequired Skills\n\nBachelor's or Master's Degree in Computer Science, or a related discipline or graduate from a top bootcamp program \n\n4+ years of software development experience \n\nProficiency in Ruby on Rails 4+, Javascript/React 16+, and SQL (PostgreSQL preferred) including professional experience\n\nExperience with asynchronous programming patterns.\n\nAbility to write scalable, maintainable code backed by quality unit tests and integration tests using tools such as RSpec, Jest, Cypress, or equivalent.\n\nCollaborative coding experience, using tools like Github and JIRA\n\nStrong communication experience with the ability to assist in aligning team, including non-technical members, on complex technical decisions\n\n\nNice-to-have skills\n\nExperience with CI/CD platforms, such as CircleCI\n\nExperience with other Javascript frameworks, such as Node.js\n\nExperience in the healthcare sector or similar secure environment\n\nExperience with design tools like Figma, Zeplin, or Invision, an eye for good design, or, at least, an eye for “this doesn’t look quite right…”.\n\nFamiliarity with Docker\n\nTechnical writing skills\n\nBenefits\n - 100% remote work environment\n - Competitive salary with incentives\n - Comprehensive, flexible benefits, including 401k, health, dental, vision, and life insurance for you (full coverage) and your family (50% coverage).\n\nApplication Process\nGoing back to our core team values, we’re excited to have a new team member, not just a new employee. Our interview process is designed to be quick and collaborative:\n\nSend us your “paperwork” – a resume and/or link to LinkedIn/Github/StackOverflow profile, along with a brief introduction and why you’re interested in working together. Start your cover letter with the word \"Camden\" \n\nInformal interview – let’s get to know each other a bit, and discuss expectations to see if there’s mutual interest.\n\nTechnical interview – we’ll check out a repo, review and scope some stories, and work through some issues together. We’re looking to understand how you like to work, while giving you a sense of the type of work we do. This is not a pointers and algorithms quiz, so don’t expect questions on obscure technical theory.\n\nIf we agree there’s a fit, you’ll have an offer within a week.",

        "description": "Hi,\n\nWe are looking for some help to restructure our current firebase database, for our mobile app. We are developing a quiz app, and we have around 36,000 questions, that have text, images and mathematical equations. At present we have our data structured under 5 categories and 241 topics. We need to rearrange the questions into quizzes that have about 25 questions per topic (241 *25 = 1446 quizzes). You can write a script that can read each question and move it to the correct structure. Or you can propose any other alternate way to accomplish the requirement. You don't have to create any data. The request is just for restructuring existing data. \n\nI will be providing you the desired new structure, access to the current database and the new database structure. You can work with our developer to collaborate for any clarifications.",

        "description": "We currently have two Shoutcast streams being streamed from a server and we need a new mobile app that will allow users to listen to them via a mobile app, and also switch between the two streams. It also needs to be done for both iOS and Android.\n\nWe already have an existing app called FUNKEDUP on both platforms if you'd like to download it and also see what is already in place now with our existing app. Here's what we need.\n\n- Develop a radio app that pulls the Shoutcast streams and allows users to switch between the two.\n- Develop for both Android and iOS.\n- Admin area to be able to insert ads.\n- Each stream should display the album artwork, song title, and artist.\n- Proper DCS to send that album, song, and artist data to Bluetooth devices like auto, etc.\n- Each song should also have a \"Buy Now\" option that will link to Amazon with our affiliate ID in the URL.\n- In App Browser for Website, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Youtube, Mixcloud, and Soundcloud Page.\n- Also link to be able to go to the store and Donate via Cash App, Venmo, or Paypal.\n- Ability for users to request songs.\n- Ability to send push notifications\n- Upload both once they are completed.\n\nThe system we are using is using a CentovaCast and we can supply the tag attributes such as \"buynow\" links, \"songrequest\" tags, etc to help with some of that process. Including supplying access to the primary control panel.\n\nThere are obviously a lot of \"minutia\" that we haven't listed here and we're okay if a template is used, as long as we have the capabilities mentioned above. PLEASE download and check out our existing FUNKEDUP app to see what we're doing currently. It's fine if you delete it shortly afterward, but it's important that we maintain all of that functionality in this new app.\n\nIf you have examples of mobile apps you've developed prior, we would love to see them and it may sway our decision.",

Must have the feature to control the speed and runtime\n\n\n\nHow does the Amazon Block sc**pt work?\n\nThe Block Grabber script is a simple script that runs on a computer. For a “production” server, the server should be extremely close to the Amazon Flex Blocks server, which is in an instance of AWS in Ashburn VA. The script logs into your Amazon Flex account, sends a command to check for blocks (the same as your refresh button on your app), decodes the block information, decides which ones to accept, then accept the specific block. All of this can occur within a few tenths of a second. In some warehouses, this process can be too long so additional scripting needs to be done in order to minimize computations and delays to beat out other scripts. Getting blocks in these warehouses can be impossible unless there are more blocks than sc**ts or that blocks come out last minute, preventing drivers that are not close by to accept them.\n\nThe Amazon Flex login information is not just a simple username and password. It is a digital key that is stored on your phone. You will need to set up your phone so that the internet is routed through a proxy server (your production server). The proxy server can then listen to the login command and capture the digital key. It can then be used by your script to log in. While your phone is linked to the proxy server, you can also check for blocks. The proxy server can output this information and show you what is being sent by your phone (refresh blocks) and what is sent by the Amazon Flex server (block information). Some people check this information daily to ensure that no changes are made. If your program responds with information formatted in an old way, Amazon could pick that up and detect that you are using a sc**pt.",

(There are a few questions in the form and depending on the answers from the client, they will be asked something else and another team member will be notified about it) Client is also immediately enrolled in Thinkific (where we have a course) (not sure if for this step we will need a webhook because unisystems doesn't let me use zapier or integrate it with Thinkific.\nThere will be delays during the process, SMS/ emails sent during 45 days. The client needs to get a text/email after 45 days asking them if they completed something (sometimes my team might be the one completing that) then depending on the client's answer they will be enrolled in another course. Also, the team is notified to do another task. There are other tasks we need to add but I am looking for a person who can help with a project that will also be requesting more adds on later on.\n\nI put $1000 dollars but after finding and interviewing you then I will send you the workflow so you can send me the quote.

        "description": "This is a simple straightforward job. At this time, I am not looking for a lot of fancy coding. I really just want someone to get it put together for me quickly in a way that I can continue to tweak and modify over time as I grow.\n\nCurrently, I have a Squarespace website I built myself in 7.0 that I would like to update and convert to 7.1 with a new look and feel. \n\nI just finished working with a content writer to update my pages. I have a home page, about, contact, and three services pages. The content writer laid the content out in what I believe is called a wireframe. It is not fancy but gives great direction already.\n\nI have a few website examples (that are also built-in Squarespace) that I could provide as examples of what I want my website to look like. I definitely think this is a job where you can just use a template—and add additional pages you want from other templates as 7.1 allows for that now. \n\nI've seen sites that have split-section functionality on some sites that I really like. I am not sure if that is part of any templates or a plugin but I may be interested in exploring that in my site. At least one of the examples I have includes this feature.\n\nMy contact page will need to connect with my Mailchimp. This is already set up on my current site. I would like to discuss if there is an option to have options on my contact page that may allow them to fill out different forms depending on what they are hiring me for. This may be a little more involved than what I am looking for at this time, but could perhaps be a separate project for you down the line. I also use Calendly would like to see if my calendar can easily be added to my contact page.\n\nI need a few graphics for my home page to pair with my services: Leadership Development, Team Development, and Leadership Coaching. If you are a designer, you could create these—or you could use a template or Canva. The only thing about the latter choice is that I don't want it to be cheesy or too standard, and the images need to look like they belong together—the same look and feel. I've attached a document that I made using Canva images just to give an idea of the type of images that could connect to my different services.\n\nI have a branding pdf, my logo, and a few images I can share with you. In some places I will probably use have you use placeholder photos that I will replace as I choose the final ones I want to go with.\n\nI have a few SEO terms that I would like you to plugin for me. I don't know anything about SEO, backlinks, breadcrumbs. if that is a skill you have, I would be interested in learning more—maybe for this project, but absolutely for a future project.\n\nI would like to get this done fairly quickly. So if you are really busy and not able to start for a few weeks, we are not a good match at this time. More than anything else, I just need to structure set up for me so that it is easy for me to go in and make updates and changes as I go.\n\nFinally, I may like to communicate my ideas to you using Loom to create a short video. Due to a learning disability, this is a fast and easy way for me to communicate.",

Below you will find the SDK for both ios and android, the recommendations for use and the contact information for the watch developer. Please respond to this email with your price and a plan of action with a tentative timeline on how you will complete this project with milestones (so that we can measure progress). \n\nLooking forward to your response, \n\nMelissa I.

Attorneys use TrialLine to make presentations about their cases to their staff, judges, and juries.\n\nWe are resigning trialline.net. The current issue technical is that TrialLine.net is a single page which is also attached to the TrialLine applications. To work around this, we have been posting additional content and tutorials to blog.trialline.net. What we want to do now is move the trialline app to app.trialline.net and install a wordpress site at TrialLine.net. Then we will take the content from blog.trialline.net and combine (and SEO redirect) it with the new wordpress site at trialline.net. That will allow us to work on the website and the app separately, without and code crossover. The design of blog.trialline.net is terrible. We are NOT trying to recreate that look, but rather update it via the Template Monster link. We want trialline.net and the blog pages to all have the same look and design.\n\nWe need a developer who can take this template: https://bit.ly/3zm2Aqf , install it on their own temporary server space, do the redesign work, and then allow us to copy and move over when we have moved the app to the new URL and are ready to deploy the new TrialLine.net. As you can see, this template has a lot of nice movement in the header. We will create some of our own custom images for this, but we would like someone who has experience creating this kind of movement and interactiveness. One of our big goals is to use creative movements in the design to draw people in to the interactiveness of our timelines. You can see samples of our interactive timelines here: https://trialline.net/sample-triallines#samples_holder - It is important to us that the person we hire have some great ideas on how to bring our product, movement, and design into the new homepage design.\n\nIn addition to the design work, we will need new contact forms created and incorporated into our Zoho.com CRM. These forms will be requests for live demos and requests to be added to our email marketing or newsletter lists. Further, we would like to hire someone now who we can continue to have a relationship with for future design support.\nLet us know turnaround time and expected costs. We would love to have the project complete by April. Please provide sample URLs of similar work. Please also confirm you can make the desktop design mobile ready and that you understand principles of SEO for the URL redirects and access files.\n\nThank you",

        "description": "I am looking for a programmer to develop a PDF editor for a Notary Public website.  The editor is one part of a platform under development that will provide notary services online.     \n\nPLEASE DO NOT BID ON THIS PROJECT IF YOU HAVE NOT  READ IT COMPLETELY AND ARE PREPARED TO DISCUSS THE PROGRAMMING SKILLS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE ASSIGNMENT.   \n\nWe already have much of the platform complete including user, notary and client registration, document uploads, id verification and KBA, payment processing,  Digital signature creation, X.509 certificate creation, and document delivery.    \n\nThe editor will access information from a MySQL database before the editing session starts to get user and document information for the editing session.   \n\nEditing feature will allow for applying a signature, adding a notary stamp, adding text and checkmarks. If possible, I would like a “white-out” feature so I can overwrite areas of a document. The software will be used in a WEBEX or ZOOM meeting so the notary can notarize the signature with one or multiple signers. I do NOT need character recognition. The original document will not be changed – just new elements added to the document.\n\nMultiple Documents: Must be able to edit a single document or package of multiple documents Document Storage: Documents will be stored in Dropbox. Future development will store documents in a stand-alone server linked to an SQL database. For editing, the documents will be retrieve from Dropbox and returned to the same folder marked complete.\n\nTagging: Prior to the meeting, the notary must “tag” the document with flags to indicate where signatures, stamps and text are needed. The tags will be links in the document during the notary sessions, so the signatures and text can be added easily.\n\nTags should be assigned to the notary or a signer so only the appropriate person can place the signature on the document. The tags must be color=coded to indicate the appropriate user.\n\nSignature: The user should be able to upload a signature via PDF or add a text based signature. The signature file can be stored in DROPBOX.\n\nDigital Certificate: Each signer must be assigned a digital certificate. When the final document is complete, any view should be able to click on a signature in the document a see the basic certificate information. \n\nCollaborative Editing: Each user must open the document on their own computer. The notary should be able to control who can add elements to the document. The notary will select a user, direct them to place their signature or text, then the notary will switch the control to the next user. (up to 10 signers plus the notary)\n\nThe issue we have had with this in the past was server load on showing changes to the documents. We only need changes to be shared on a mouse-click on Enter key. I don’t need every screen to update on every key stroke. The server load would be a major drag.\n\nAudit Trail – The program must create a second PDF document with the same name + “.audit”. This document will log when stamps and signatures are placed. The log will contain the signer name, item placed, date and time. The signer will one be able to place one type of item – a signature – but it will be placed multiple time and will be logged on each one. The notary will be able to place either a signature or stamp and the log must indicate which.\n\nNotary Log – After the WEBEX session is complete, the notary must add an entry to his electronic notary log. The log will also be on DropBox but will eventually be moved to a SQL database. The log will record: Signers name, ID type, Type of signing, date and time. This info will eventually be pulled from a database, but for now, the notary will enter in manually.\n\nThe web platform that is being created by my development team already includes notary and signer sign up, calendar management, document management, ID verification and authentication, billing, and document delivery. We have been under development for many months.\n\nWe had another freelance developer working on this, but he disappeared before the project was complete. We don’t have any of his work.",

I want it to be a sort of community app which teaches people more about watches. People have a personal account in which they have all of their own information, ex. favorites.\n\nI have made a couple of designs of how I would like it to appear. For this I will need a couple of features. \nThis includes the following: \n\nA home screen with all of the features mentioned below, with easy access to all of the features.\n\nA catalog with different watch brands and watches within those brands, which I am able to add and edit myself.\n\nA daily watch tab, this sends out a notification to the user. The notification message will say something like ”Get to know this watch now!”. Once clicked, the user will be brought to a new random(based on their choose of favorites) watch page where they can learn something about the watch. Once a user has read the daily watch, they will be able to tap something like ”Learned” which will save the watch to a “knowledge catalog”. This will make sure the app will not show this watch again.\n\nA news tab, just a simple but functional news page with articles that I am able to upload myself.\n\nA market tab, in which users can track the current value of watches.\n\nWhen the user starts the app for the first time, they can choose their favorite brands in their account. The app will only show a daily watch based on the user's favorites.\n\nThe app is supposed to be free to download with in-app purchases. I will explain this later since this is not a main focus at this point.\n\nAt last I would like an admin app/function in which only I can add things to the app like new watches and news articles.\n\nPlease let me know if you are able to do this and what your quotation would be. I am open to all suggestions and feedback. If you are interested in my designs I will be happy to send them to you.\n\nLooking forward to be hearing from you!\n\nKind Regards,\n\nDanilo",

        "description": "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!\n\nHello all,\n\nLooking for an experienced web developer with ecommerce background specializing in building custom web-to-print plug-ins for either Shopify or WooCommerce.\n\nAs I don't have an existing website yet, I don't have a preference for either platforms but I'm leaning towards Shopify.\n\nThis job is to develop a plug-in that enables users to choose from different product types and upload photos to preview them before placing the order.\n\nThere are 3 different product types with slightly different UX (Page 1):\n1. Square photo frames:\nSquare photo frames have fixed orientation but also have different styles (variants)\n\n2. Rectangular photo frames:\nVery similar to square frames but they can have either one of two orientations: Portrait and landscape. Choosing an orientation changes the appearance of the frame and the cropping window shape.\n\n3. Collages:\nCollages are special because they come in preset configuration of both square and rectangle in any number of arrangements but they don't offer the same flexibility such as changing number of frames or changing the style.\n\nPlugin features:\n1. Multiple photo selection: Users can select and upload multiple photos at once, resulting in corresponding number of photo frames (Page 4).\n2. Pre-cart live price calculation (Page 5).\n3. Ability to change selected frame style (for rectangle and square frames) (Page 6).\n4. Some frame styles have different photo placeholder (Page 6).\n5. Photo quality checks: we'll conduct photo quality check two times, one when uploading the photo and one when the user crops it to fit in frame (Page 8).\n6. Incentivize users to add more product (i.e. buy 2 more and get x% off) (Page 9).\n7. Supports major photo file types including (.heic).\n8. When the user finishes choosing and editing their selection, show an alert that they've made the adjustments to their satisfaction.\n9. Low resolution photos should be flagged.\n10. RTL language support (Arabic).\n\nConsiderations that require clarification:\n1. Because each product type and style combination is a different 'variant', how do we integrate them with either Shopify or Woo products tab?\n2. Can we easily track stock status for each variant and maybe hide those out of stock from user selection?\n3. Is adding different variants as easy as typically adding products?\n4. How to adjust image place holder for different frame types and styles?\n5. On the dashboard and after the user places an order, How do you include user photos and selected frame types/styles?\n6. Do custom frame thumbs show in cart &  on checkout?\n\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Mobile friendly, basic webstore with support for multiple currencies and Arabic language*.\n2. Fully functional plug-in according to documentation.\n3. Products setup & upload.\n4. Full source code pushed to our repo.\n5. Entire project published to our customer facing webstore within set time frame.\n* I'm not asking for website design.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts specially on the 'considerations' section. and please take a look at the attached document and if you have any questions shoot away.\n\nP.s We'll discuss milestones before hiring.\n\nThanks,\nAmin",

However, the process can be slow, unreliable, and subject to inaccuracies. The prototype marketplace uniquely encourages collaboration of resources and inventory availability across multiple suppliers simultaneously, to the financial benefit of both the Airline and Supplier.\n\nThe prototype needs to demonstrate how the network self-proliferates with sales teams, planning/buyers, AOG desk operatives and technicians/engineers across multiple levels of suppliers and sub-supplier tiers, airlines and holders of large and diversified inventories. The prototype needs to provide a live communication platform for sharing AOG matters, experiences and advice from AOG, Planning/Buying, Technical and Sales desks connected to the network. \n\nTARGET AUDIENCES:\n \nTarget Audience 1\nAge: 35-50\nOccupation: Airline or Supplier AOG Desk (Operative / Manager)\nChallenges: May not be open to change \n\nTarget Audience 2\nAge: 25-45\nOccupation: Airline Planner/Buyer (Executive, Manager, Head)\n\nTarget Audience 3\nAge: 35-60\nOccupation: Airline or Supplier Technician / Engineer (Lead, Manager, Director)\n\nTarget Audience 4\nAge: 25-50\nOccupation: Supplier or Airline Sales (Executive / Sales Manager / Sales Director)\n\nFUNCTIONALITIES\n\nSee functional decomposition attached for primary features, the prototype doesn’t have to include all features and functionality specified.\n\nMOCKUPS\n\nSee draft wireframes attached\n\nBUDGET\n\nFixed Contract $500\n\nDELIVERY\n\n1 MONTH\n\nPlease note in your quotation response we require your submission to \"directly\" answer and satisfy the following questions (and where applicable supported with relevant, facts, statistical information, figures, use cases etc.):\n\n1)What are your clear i)business needs, ii)technological needs in order for you to complete this project ?\n2)What specific Systems, Tools & Resources will you use to complete this project ?\n3)What approach will you take and where will the focus of your solution be ?\n4)What is the size of your Project Team & what are they're roles ?\n5)What external wider impacts do you have in order for you to deliver on this project ?\n6)What do you see are the main risks for this project ?",

This means that dynamic pages and dynamic content need to be created, while most static pages will be created by our in-house team after your development project is complete. Pages and fields for this development project will be explicitly specified.\n\nOverview\nThis is a multi-vendor listing website, with a member area for both the buyer and supplier. There is no e-commerce functionality: suppliers are listed, they do not pay to be listed.\n\nThe supplier completes a Questionnaire as part of their on-boarding, where they give various business information for approval. Upon Questionnaire completion, the supplier has the option to generate a Results Report based on the Questionnaire.\n\nBefore a buyer has registered, they can perform an example supplier search, that shows dummy information and an Example Report. The buyer registers with basic information, and gets in contact with the site owner (offline) to settle subscription details and payment. No payments are accepted and no invoices are managed through this website. Once subscribed, the site owner/admin will approve the buyer on the website, which enables the buyer to access their buyer profile and perform full supplier searches. An approved buyer has access to dynamic, generated Supplier Reports; these reports can take the form of either a multi-page report based on 1 supplier (Supplier Report), or a 1-page comparative report of up to 3 suppliers (Supplier Comparison). \n\nSelected sections of the Questionnaire, Results Report, Supplier Report and Supplier Comparison are in-scope for this project; the remaining pages are out of scope, and marked as such on the Figma design. The Example Report is in scope. \n\nA user can register as both buyer and supplier with the same login details, and they can switch between their supplier and buyer dashboards from the navigation bar.\n\nMore granular details are included in the attached Project Brief document.",

We are in the process of revamping this platform and we have already had a design made for this purpose. \n\nCurrently we have two in house developers. In order to create this new platform in React from scratch we seek the help of an additional expert in this field. We envision that you would be an integral (remote) part of our team for the duration of the project. The scope has been defined, but we do not know how long the project will take. It will at least take 1 month. We prefer 40 hours a week, but at least 32.\n\n- the platform -:\nBuilding a translation management platform comes with its own interesting challenges. It is incomparable with a regular webshop. In the translation world we deal with many dependent systems where the content lives. Numerous types of document formats. And complex algorithms to analyse texts. \nOut platform enables customers to manually create new translation projects, but also allows customers to automatically integrate their existing cms. We offer a wide range of options to choose from, for example different qualities of translations. The payment process is facilitated by an integrated wallet. \n\n- how we work -\nWhen you decide to work with us, we envision the following process. We will present the new design of the platform and we will make a plan accordingly. We have already setup an initial React project that is connected to our backend system using NextJS. We will stay responsible for the backend endpoints, which are documented in an API documentation. There will be close communication through Slack and Teams throughout the entire project. In order to support where needed we will have a daily stand-up and weekly functional checkup as well.",

Everything is fine but I cannot get to retieve the Json with the scraped data throug Axios making  GET POST UPDATE nor DELETE request.\n\nThe job consists of :\n1- Stablish the way to React retrieve the Json with the scrapped data through the Api (which already exists). Now the writes a Json file on the client folder, which i think is the reason why i cannot build on production.\n2- React from the frontend uploads a new data to scrappe a new tiker. Now even if the frontend is made, I have to write on a Json file that Puppeteers reads to scrappe that data.\n3- React has to be the ability to delete a Data from the Scrappe Json.\n4- Now Puppeteer scrapes the whole Json object with all the adata added. But I think is better to scrappe one by one.\n5- MongoDB installation, now is pointing ti Atlas but the num er of contacts are full very quickly\n\nThe job maybe looks large but all the pieces are already done, and could be achieved very soon.

We have the Figma designs for the mobile versions as well.\n\nThere is a very minor aspect of animation in one section (just some bubbles that gently move randomly), but all in all the pages are mostly static and straightforward.\n\nSpeed and good English communication skills are a must. We would like to be ready to launch within two weeks.\n\nI will share the designs with you if I am interested in your profile.\n\nMany thanks for taking the time to read this :)",

The code should be written in python and meet PEP8 standards. Beyond the code itself, the project should contain sentry, unit tests, the serverless.yml file, and an informative README file. We already have a working version, but it is part of a monolithic Django app that we are currently breaking up. We will provide the existing elasticsearch queries as part of the project.\n\nReceiver\nAlso as part of this task, we need a script written to receive the results of the microservice to postgres via the original Django app. The Django app is marked as server in the diagram. While we are moving the process of tagging itself to the microservice, the Django application still needs to store the results of the microservice to postgres. The app uses Django Rest Framework. We do not need this receiver added to the project above, it can be simply shared as a file and we will add it to our app.\n\nA key feature of SaaS, TrackTrack, is Themes. A theme is a collection of keywords and helps group and filter documents based on whether or not they contain specific keywords. We need a simple Themes microservice which:\n1. receives a list of keywords (theme) along with any additional filters (see section below)\n2. searches an elasticsearch index for those keywords taking into account any additional filters\n3. adds the theme id to those documents (laws) that contain the keywords\n4. asynchronously returns the ids of the documents (laws) to which the keywords have been added along with the theme id\n\nWe similarly need the option to:\n- update themes when the keywords or other filters (more on that below) change and\n- delete a theme and have the theme id removed from the elasticsearch index.\n\nTheme example:\n\"О внесении изменений в водный Кодекс\" AND (\"закон\" OR \"законопроект\") AND \"озеро Байкал\"\nбезопасность железнодорожный переезд железнодорожный Правила безопасности железнодорожный безопасность движения и эксплуатации на железнодорожном транспорте безопасность движения поездов обеспечение безопасности на железнодорожном транспорте переход железнодорожные пути железнодорожный неустановленных местах противопожарный режим охрана железнодорожный пожарный железнодорожный противопожарный железнодорожный Промышленная безопасность Безопасность перевозок грузов Безопасность перевозок багажа \"безопасность перевозок\" AND (\"пассажиров\" OR \"багаж\" OR \"грузобагажа\") \"экологическая безопасность\" AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"технический регламент \" AND \"безопасность\" AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"транспортное происшествие\" AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"крушение\" AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"железнодорожный транспорт\" AND \"авария\" \"транспорт\" AND \"инцидент\" \"железнодорожный транспорт\" AND \"расследование причин\" AND (\"авария\" OR \"происшествие\") \"противопожарная опашка\" \"травмирование граждан\" \"поезд восстановительный\" \"безопасность высокоскоростного железнодорожного транспорта\" \"безопасность\" AND ( \"движение\" OR \"эксплуатация\") AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"безопасность железнодорожного подвижного состава\" \"безопасность инфраструктуры железнодорожного транспорта\" \"безопасность по параметрам движения\" AND \"технический персонал\" AND \"поезд\" \"безопасность движения и эксплуатации\" AND \"технического средства\" \"безопасность услуг\" AND \"перевозка пассажиров\" AND \"железнодорожный транспорт\" \"безопасность движени и эксплуатации железнодорожного транспорта\" \"воздействие транспорта на окружающую среду\" \"Государственный надзор в области железнодорожного транспорта\" \"Правила нахождения граждан и размещения объектов в зонах повышенной опасности, выполнения в этих зонах работ, проезда и перехода через железнодорожные пути\"\n\nElasticsearch mapping:\nWe are attaching the mapping of the elasticsearch index to be queried. The keywords should be searched for in the following fields: \"title\" and \"text\".\n\nAdditional filters:\nWe also need the option to only search for keywords in documents that meet additional filters. There are two types of additional filters.\ntitle_only = True/False. This specifies that keywords should be found in either \"title\" or \"text\" or only in the \"title\"\n\"source\", \"category\", and \"document_type\". If specified in the request, then for each and any of these fields the request will provide additional keywords. For example, \"sources\":[\"Правительство России\"] or \"sources\":[\"Правительство России\"], \"document_types\":[\"Законопроекты\"]. These filters should act as AND and not OR filters.\n\nReceiver\nThe receiver should be able to receive the results of the microservice using Django Rest Framework You can see the model of the Law object attached. For each document id (law id) returned by the microservice, the receiver should add or remove the theme. The id of the theme is should also be returned by the service.\n\nPlease note I respond mostly during working hours only. I plan to make a hiring decision on Monday evening, Tuesday morning.",
